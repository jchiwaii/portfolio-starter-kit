summary: "A breathless sprint through mist and fear, where survival blurs with shadow and instinct."

I was heaving, trying to catch my breath, but the air was so thick and cold it felt like trying to breathe underwater. It wasn't just mist; it was a heavy, wet blanket that tasted like old leaves and damp earth when I sucked it in. I couldn't see five meters ahead, maybe less, just the vague, shifting shapes of the tree trunks looming out of the grey. The morning dew had turned the narrow path into a slick, dark ribbon of mud, and every single step was a desperate, sliding gamble. I could hear the wet slap-slap of my own feet, like that of the Djembe drums, a sound that felt deafeningly loud in the quiet forest, and then, underneath that, the heavier, less careful thudding behind us.

My heart wasn't just thumping; it was a frantic, wet drumbeat trying to punch its way out of my ribs, fueled by the sprint and the pure, blinding fear that had gripped me the moment I woke up. I risked a quick look over my shoulder, a split-second decision that felt like stopping time entirely. Menza was still there, maybe three steps behind, his face tight, eyes wide and black with pure adrenaline. We didn't exchange words, couldn't, but his face could tell it, his look, it was a promise, a desperate, shared terror that said, We are in this, and we are not stopping.

My legs, man, they had gone completely numb, just two heavy, useless weights pumping automatically, driven only by the primal need to survive. The sleepy haze from three minutes ago, when I was yanked out of a deep, warm sleep, was completely burned away, replaced by this sharp, burning terror. I was literally afraid of death, and it had come knocking, not politely, but fast as lightning and with absolutely no mercy.

Then the sound came again, cutting through the damp air, closer than I wanted to admit. "Go! Go! They should not escape!" It wasn't just a shout; it was a raw, gravelly roar from the Ugoso, and it seemed to echo off the wet trees, multiplying the threat. And the sound of them running, that was the worst part, worse than the shouting. It wasn't their heavy breathing, but the way those heavy tools, the pangas and the machetes, swung and scraped against the low branches and thick undergrowth, a metallic shing sound that felt like a countdown. They carried those things like they weighed nothing, like they were just extensions of their arms, ready to swing. I knew they were running as if those blades were light as feathers, and that meant they were serious, deadly serious. I just kept pushing, focusing on the next patch of mud, the next tree, praying the mist would hold just long enough to hide us. I couldn't stop. I just couldn't.

I couldn't shake the fear for Menza. It wasn't the Ugoso I was watching right then; it was him. I was terrified he would just stop, just give in to the exhaustion and the pain. Those cramps in his legs, I knew they were coming, ready to lock up and overpower whatever resolve he had left to keep living. He had told me, just yesterday, how tired he was of running, of hiding from people who had decided we deserved to die, no matter what. It felt like trying to hide from ghosts, honestly, because you never knew when they would actually show up, or where they were looking from. It was like trying to outrun your own shadow; it's always there, go left, it follows, right, it's right there, forward, it's still following like a faithful servant. Very difficult.

We hadn't eaten anything real for days, but that wasn't the main problem. Hunger was a slow killer, painful, sure, like drowning is slow and painful. But I preferred that. I preferred the slow, clean death of starvation to falling into the hands of those beasts, the Ugoso. They had no mercy, none at all. That kind of death, the one they offered, was an unimaginable ordeal. Suicide felt like a better option sometimes, just to avoid their touch. And that's what scared me most now. Not death itself, I had accepted that possibility long ago, especially given the hostile living conditions, but the specific, crazy, brutal death these men promised. That fear was a cold, sharp stone in my gut, driving me forward even as my lungs screamed for air, trying to catch a breath in this thick, cold air that tasted like wet earth and old leaves.

I risked another glance back, a longer one this time. Menza was stumbling now, not just running. His breathing was ragged, a wet, rattling sound that sounded too close to a sob. He looked like he was fighting the ground itself, trying to keep his feet moving when his body wanted to quit. I was afraid, afraid that he would stop and give in. I was worried that the pain would soon overpower his resolve to live. This was it!

"Menza!" I hissed, not stopping, just turning my head slightly, keeping my eyes on the slick path ahead. He didn't answer, couldn't spare the breath, but I saw him grab his thigh, just for a second, a flicker of raw, agonising pain crossing his face before he forced it back into that mask of desperate resolve. That was it. That was the moment I was dreading, the moment the fear of the Ugoso would be replaced by the sheer, physical impossibility of moving forward. These brutal men had no mercy. They had an absolute resolve to kill and nothing else.

If he stopped, they would catch him, and then they would catch me. I couldn't carry him; we were too exposed, and the path was too steep and slippery. But I couldn't leave him either. That thought, the idea of running on while he was taken, it felt worse than the Ugoso's pangas, a betrayal that would kill me slowly, even if I escaped.

Then the sound came again, cutting through the damp air, closer than before. It wasn't the shouting this time, it was the scraping, that metallic shing-shing of their tools hitting the low branches and the thick, wet undergrowth, maybe just fifty meters back, maybe less. It sounded like a terrible clock ticking down my life, counting the seconds until they rounded the bend. We had to get off this path. It was too straight, too easy for them to follow, like a dark arrow pointing right at us. I spotted a break in the trees, a tangle of thorny bushes and rocks leading sharply uphill, away from the main trail and into the denser, darker part of the woods. It looked impossible, a terrible, lung-busting climb, but it was hidden, a wall of green that might buy us time.

That thick, grey mist was our only friend right now, a perfect, cold curtain hiding us from the Ugoso, and the dense bush was good camouflage, making it easy to disappear, to melt into the shadows and the damp earth, which was exactly what we needed after leaving the main path. But that was the problem, wasn't it? If we couldn't see them, they couldn't see us, but the reverse was also true, and every snap of a twig, every rustle in the undergrowth that wasn't Menza or me, sent a jolt of ice through my spine. It meant we were blind, moving through a world where the enemy could be right there, three feet away, hidden by the same wet blanket that protected us, and we wouldn't know they were there until it was too late. I kept listening for that metallic shing of their tools. Still, the mist swallowed sound, too, making the silence almost worse than the noise, because I knew they were close, maybe just out of sight, moving like shadows in this perfect, grey cover that was both our salvation and a terrible, suffocating trap.

"Up!" I gasped, pointing with my chin, my voice barely a whisper, just a puff of cold air. We scrambled off the path immediately. The mud here was worse, deeper, sucking at my feet with a sickening schlop sound. Thorns immediately snagged my trousers, tearing the thin fabric, scratching my skin, but I didn't care about the sting. The fear numbed the paon. The rocks were slick with moss and dew, and I had to use my hands, pulling myself up, tasting the metallic tang of blood where I bit my lip trying to keep the air in. Menza followed, slower, using the thicker trees for leverage, his breath coming in short, painful gasps. I heard him curse under his breath, a low, guttural sound in Swahili, something about the pain, something about the injustice of it all. But he was moving. That was the only thing that mattered. We were moving, and the thick brush was muffling our sounds, maybe even slowing them down, forcing them to push through the thorns we had just torn through.

I reached a small, flat ledge behind a massive, moss-covered boulder, one that smelled strongly of wet earth and decay. I dropped, not sitting, just collapsing onto my knees, trying to pull air into my chest, trying to stop the violent shaking of my legs. Menza slid in beside me, his eyes closed for a second, just one second of pure, bone-deep exhaustion. We listened, holding our breath, trying to slow the frantic pounding in my own ears so I could hear something else. Nothing. Just the wind rustling the high leaves and the distant, muffled sound of a bird. We had bought maybe thirty seconds. Maybe a minute. Maybe an hour. But one thing was for sure, it wasn't enough, not nearly enough, but it was something, a tiny, fragile victory in this endless, terrifying morning. We still had to keep going. We just had to.
