As I lay my eyes to sleep, the memories of the day jiggled through my mind. I just couldn't shake it off, that feeling, you know? It clung to me like the humid air outside, heavy and suffocating. It weaved me. What has become of me! It was frightening. It was a shocker even unto myself. The thought of what I'd done, what we'd done, kept replaying, a silent movie reel behind my eyelids, each frame sharper than the last. It was a strange kind of cold dread, even with the sweat trickling down my back. I pulled the thin sheet up to my chin, but it offered no comfort, just another layer to trap the unease. The drunkard's laugh from the pub twisted into something else in my mind, a mocking echo of my own conscience, maybe. I wondered if anyone else out there, in the quiet dark, was feeling this same knot in their stomach. The mosquitoes were noisy. It was as if they were an impending punishment for what had transpired during the day.

The window was like a black mirror, reflecting just enough of the room to make the shadows dance. I could almost see my own wide eyes staring back, a stranger's face in the dimness. Beyond that, the street was just a smear of deeper black, broken only by the faint, sickly yellow glow of a distant streetlamp, barely cutting through the gloom. It was glitching. It made the alleyways between the buildings look like gaping mouths, ready to swallow whatever dared to venture in.

I kept thinking about the smell, that metallic tang that had lingered in the air, even after we'd tried to clear it. It was still there, in my nose, in my memory, a constant reminder. And the silence, it wasn't really silent, was it? There was the hum of the old refrigerator in the kitchen, a distant dog barking, and then, something else. A faint scraping sound, like something being dragged, or maybe just the wind playing tricks with a loose shutter somewhere down the street. My breath hitched. I told myself it was nothing, just my mind running wild, but my heart was thumping a frantic rhythm against my ribs. I pressed my face against the cool glass, trying to see, trying to pierce the darkness, but it just stared back, impenetrable. It felt like the night itself was holding its breath, waiting. And I was just there, caught in it, unable to move, unable to look away from the vast, empty canvas that held too many secrets.

I was still there, pressed against the cold glass, trying to make sense of the shadows, when it came. Not a gentle tap, but a sharp, deliberate knock. It cut through the night, through the distant pub laughter, through the hum of the fridge, and right through me. My breath caught in my throat. This was it. My heart, which had just started to slow its frantic beat, lurched again, a painful throb against my ribs. It wasn't a neighbor, not at this hour. And it wasn't a mistake. This knock, it felt like it had been waiting, just like I had been waiting, for the other shoe to drop.

My blood ran cold, a sudden, icy rush through my veins. Every muscle in my body tensed, locking me in place, unable to move, unable to even breathe properly. Who could it be? The question screamed in my head, but I already knew the answer, or at least, I knew what it had to be about. It was about that. The thing we did, the thing I still couldn't quite believe I was a part of, the unimaginable act that had stained the daylight hours and now seeped into the deepest parts of the night. They knew. That was the only explanation. Someone knew. Too bad… Too bad…

I squeezed my eyes shut for a second, a desperate, childish wish that if I just didn't look, it wouldn't be real. But the knock came again, louder this time, more insistent. It echoed in the small room, bouncing off the walls, filling every corner with its ominous presence. My mouth felt dry, like sandpaper. I could taste the fear, metallic and bitter. My hands, I noticed, were shaking, a fine tremor that spread through my arms. I wanted to run, to hide under the bed, to disappear. But there was nowhere to go. The door felt like a wall, a barrier, but also a thin membrane separating me from whatever horror waited on the other side. The air in the room, already heavy, seemed to thicken, pressing down on me, making it hard to draw a full breath. I could hear my own ragged breathing, loud in my ears, a frantic whisper in the suffocating silence that followed the second knock. And then, a voice, muffled, but undeniably there, just beyond the wood. It was low, a murmur, but it was enough. It was enough to confirm every chilling suspicion, every creeping dread that had been building since the sun went down. This was it. This was it, John…
