My sleepy eyes could not comprehend whether I was still dreaming or this was a reality. The bus was making dangerous swerves that even made my head feel dizzy. It was as though this was a dream, or this was the reality. Travelling during the night can sometimes be a very weary affair. Pitch darkness except for the front lights, the road was very bumpy and we definetly were the only car on the road. The air inside the bus was thick and smelled like stale cigarette smoke mixed with the faint, metallic scent of hot engine oil, a smell that always reminds me of cheap travel and bad decisions. We were deep into the mountains now, I could tell because every time the driver took a corner, the bus tilted so far I genuinely thought we might roll right off the edge, and the driver, I swear, he was treating this massive vehicle like it was a sports car on a racetrack. He wasn't just driving fast; he was driving aggressively, slamming the accelerator down on the short straightaways and then wrenching the wheel around the bends without even touching the brakes until the last possible second, making the tires squeal in protest against the rough asphalt.

It was 1 AM exactly, I checked my phone just to confirm the time, the screen lighting up my face for a brief second before I quickly dimmed it again. A faint smile - that of despair was written on my face. Outside, the night was actually beautiful, serene in a way that felt completely disconnected from the chaos happening inside this metal box. The moon was high and bright, casting long, sharp shadows of the roadside trees, and the sky was so clear you could see thousands of stars, tiny pinpricks of light that seemed to mock my current state of panic. I had run away. That’s the simple truth of it. I had sneaked out of the apartment around 10 PM, leaving a vague, cowardly note on the coffee table, thinking I had bought myself at least three days of silence, three days to just breathe and figure out how to face the mess I had made. I was heading to my cousin’s place, twelve hours away, a place where no one knew me and I could just be invisible for a while.

But life, or maybe just fate, doesn't care about your stupid little plans. We stopped for gas maybe an hour ago, and that’s when the text came through, a single notification that felt like a punch to the gut. It was Sarah. My wife. Flight landed early. Taxiing now. Where are you? She wasn't supposed to be back until Friday. She was supposed to be at that conference, giving me the time I thought I needed to cool down, to let the dust settle after the worst fight we’d ever had, one where I finally admitted the huge, stupid mistake I’d been hiding for months. So now she was coming home, unexpectedly, and she was going to find that empty apartment and that pathetic note.

My mind was racing faster than the bus. I had to mend things, but this wasn't just a small argument about who left the dishes out. This was about trust, the core of everything. I had lied, repeatedly, about something that mattered deeply to us, and now the foundation felt like sand. How do you rebuild trust when you’ve shattered it into a million pieces? I kept replaying the last conversation in my head, the sound of her voice when she finally understood the depth of the deception. It wasn't anger I heard; it was a quiet, devastating finality. A very loud deafening silence that screamed within her bones. I was written all over her veins. That sound was worse than any shouting.

The bus driver suddenly downshifted hard, the engine roaring, and we took a hairpin turn that threw me against the window so violently I gasped, and was now awake. A woman two rows ahead muttered something sharp in Swahili, but the driver just ignored her, his silhouette hunched over the wheel, focused only on the road ahead, or maybe just focused on getting this miserable shift over with. I wondered if he was even looking at the road, or if he was just driving by instinct, by muscle memory. I needed that kind of instinct right now, the ability to just know how to navigate the next few hours without crashing and burning. I pulled out my phone again, my thumb hovering over her contact. Should I text her back? Should I lie and say I was just out getting late-night groceries? No, that was stupid. I had to be honest, finally. But how do you start a text message that needs to fix a year of mistakes? Hey, sorry I ran away, but I’m on a bus driven by a lunatic and I need to tell you I love you and I’m sorry for everything. It sounded ridiculous.

I looked out the window again. We were passing through a tiny, dark village, just a few scattered lights, and I saw a dog bark once, a lonely sound swallowed quickly by the night. I felt just as lonely, hurtling toward a destination I wasn't sure I wanted to reach anymore, because reaching it meant facing the music. I knew I had to turn this bus around, somehow, but we were already too far. So I just sat there, the diesel fumes making my head ache, listening to the relentless, terrifying speed of the bus, and the sound of the wind making melodies, a dirge for my funeral, while I trying to figure out if I could possibly fix something this broken before the sun came up.

Never again. Never again…
