          <p>
            Nothing is too hard to crack. I'm driven by a chronic curiosity and
            a passion for telling stories through code, pictures and data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building scalable creative solutions that at least go beyond the
            hype.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes I write, sometimes I code, other times I am behind a lens,
            and most of the times, I enjoy my own company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Open to long term meaningful projects that involve data, AI, web2,
            and web3.
          </p>
          <p>Ardent love of African Literature.</p>
          <p>Perfect mind. Excellent Spirit.</p>
